# StarGazer

Hey there, future star tracker! Ready to take a stroll through the cosmic fields of GitHub? StarGazer is your personal telescope to observe the stars of the coding universe.

## What’s the Big Bang Here?

This fun CLI tool skyrockets you into the GitHub galaxy, letting you spot the most starred repos created between any two dates. It's like time travel, but for code!

## Features

- Explore GitHub repos stargazed between any date range.
- Effortless CLI — Just input the start and end date, and off you go!
- Discover what's been shining bright in the developer's night sky.

## Prepare for Lift Off

To get started, you need:

- Go language installed in your command module (aka computer).
- An adventurous spirit for code exploration!

## Command Your Ship

Fire up the engines with:
./main YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD

Just replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with your desired timeline and watch the magic happen.

## Notes from Mission Control

- Your search query is crafted like this: `created:YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Be aware of black holes (GitHub's rate limiting).
- Results are sorted by the star count, from supernova to shining.

## Contribute to the Constellation

Found a new planet or have a fix for the gravity pull? Contributions are as welcome as a comet on a clear night!
